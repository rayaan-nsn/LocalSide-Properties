Principal rooms face extensive gardens and offer high ceilings and excellent flow for family living",
      "description": "An exceptional Grade II Listed Lutyens residence (1,040 sq m/11,197 sq ft) occupying a magnificent double width plot backing directly onto unspoilt acres of Turner’s Wood Bird Sanctuary. The inspiration for Fairwood House came from Sir Edwin Lanseer Lutyens, the 20th century’s leading British architect. Lutyens was commissioned to design many of the great English country houses as well as being appointed by the Government to design and build Viceroy House in Delhi, which has since become the residence of the president of India. This imposing property, situated on a double plot of approximately 0.6 acres, faces due south to the rear and also backs directly onto Turners Wood, a 7-acre private bird sanctuary. In 2006, the property was completely rebuilt behind the original facade. In doing so, the current owners brief was to create a house fit for the twenty-first century whilst ensuring that the layout remained loyal to the original that Lutyens created. All of the principal reception rooms on the ground floor are facing the extensive gardens, are interconnected and provide excellent flow and family living accommodation. The house features exceptionally high ceilings, with most of the rooms on the ground floor enjoying ceiling heights in excess of 3.3metres and some rising to well over 4 metres.",
